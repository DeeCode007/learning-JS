// how to use single quote, double quote and a backlash in a string data type

// let string = "I am learning 'javascript'"
// let string1 = "I am learning \'javascript'\ "
// let string2 = "I am learning \"javascript\" "
// let string4 = "this is called \\ backlash character" //output = this is called \ backlash character
// console.log(string)

// string is primitive data type but there is a string object too in java script we can create it by using 'new' keyword and string() constructor. after creating a string object, we can use its prototype methods like charat,split,indexof.

let stringObj = new String(I am learning Javascript)
console.log(stringObj)
