// JS data types are dynamic means if you declare a variable let and define it with a number data type but later when you reassign a value, you can reassign anything you want like string whatever . variables data type will be changed according to it.

let num1 = 2500; //it is number data type
num1 ="number" // it is string data type

//bigint =  when value of number data type is more than x power 52 than its data type would be big int.
//let x = BigInt("bigint value");

//string 
let y = "string";

//boolean => boolean can have only two values true or false . it is often used in conditional testing
let a = 5 , b= 6, c = 5; 
a == c ; // returns true
a == b // returns false

//typeof => typeof operator tell us about which type of variable it is. 
console.log (typeof y);

// undefined is when we don't give a value to a variable 
let undfnd ; // undfnd is a undefined datat type

//NULL => IT IS A EMPTY VARIABLE
let car = null ; // car variable has null type;
car => "" // car vari

//able has string data type as there are double inverted coma . nulll and this both are differents.
